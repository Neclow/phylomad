This locus is at LOW risk of leading to biased inferences due to compositional heterogeneity. Homogeneous substitution models such as those of the GTR family might not lead to biased inferences due to compositional heterogeneity.

This locus is at LOW risk of leading to based inferences according to assessment using the multinomial likelihood. This suggests that the model is not underparameterized.

This locus is at MEDIUM risk of leading to biased inferences according to the biochemical diversity. Some explanations include considerable substitutional saturation or a variable subsitution process across branches and across sites.

This locus is at HIGH risk of leading to biased inferences according to the consistency index. One explanation is that there is strong variation in the rates of evolution across both branches and sites. This test might also reject the model if the locus is extremely short.

This locus is at LOW risk of leading to biased inferences according to the mahalanobis summary statistic. This suggests that the model unlikely to lead to biased inferences according to the group of test statistics considered.

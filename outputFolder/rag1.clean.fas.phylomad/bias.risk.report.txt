This locus is at LOW risk of leading to biased inferences due to compositional heterogeneity. Homogeneous substitution models such as those of the GTR family might not lead to biased inferences due to compositional heterogeneity.

This locus is at LOW risk of leading to based inferences according to assessment using the multinomial likelihood. This suggests that the model is not underparameterized.

This locus is at LOW risk of leading to biased inferences according to the biochemical diversity. This suggests that there might not be excessive saturation or the substitution process might be relatively constant across branches and across sites.

This locus is at LOW risk of leading to biased inferences according to the consistency index. This suggests that the substitution process might be relatively constant across branches and across sites.

This locus is at LOW risk of leading to biased inferences according to the mahalanobis summary statistic. This suggests that the model unlikely to lead to biased inferences according to the group of test statistics considered.

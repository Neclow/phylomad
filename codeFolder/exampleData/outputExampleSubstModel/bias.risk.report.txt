This locus is at HIGH risk of leading to biased inferences due to compositional heterogeneity. It is highly unadvisable to analyse this locus using homogeneous substitution models such as those of the GTR family.

This locus is at LOW risk of leading to based inferences according to assessment using the multinomial likelihood. This suggests that the model is not underparameterized.

This locus is at HIGH risk of leading to biased inferences according to the biochemical diversity. Some explanations include excessive substitutional saturation or a highly variable subsitution process across branches and across sites. This test might also reject the model if the locus is extremely short.

This locus is at HIGH risk of leading to biased inferences according to the consistency index. One explanation is that there is strong variation in the rates of evolution across both branches and sites. This test might also reject the model if the locus is extremely short.
